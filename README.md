<p>In <a href="/wiki/Cryptography" title="Cryptography">cryptography</a>, a <b>Caesar cipher</b>, also known as <b>Caesar's cipher</b>, the <b>shift cipher</b>, <b>Caesar's code</b> or <b>Caesar shift</b>, is one of the simplest and most widely known <a href="/wiki/Encryption" title="Encryption">encryption</a> techniques. It is a type of <a href="/wiki/Substitution_cipher" title="Substitution cipher">substitution cipher</a> in which each letter in the <a href="/wiki/Plaintext" title="Plaintext">plaintext</a> is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the <a href="/wiki/Alphabet" title="Alphabet">alphabet</a>. For example, with a left shift of 3, <tt>D</tt> would be replaced by <tt>A</tt>, <tt>E</tt> would become <tt>B</tt>, and so on. The method is named after <a href="/wiki/Julius_Caesar" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>, who used it in his private correspondence.</p>

<p>The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the <a href="/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher" title="Vigenère cipher">Vigenère cipher</a>, and still has modern application in the <a href="/wiki/ROT13" title="ROT13">ROT13</a> system. As with all single alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no <a href="/wiki/Communication_security" title="Communication security" class="mw-redirect">communication security</a>.</p>
